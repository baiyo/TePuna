                            The leadership at Pakuranga College have demonstrated one of the most mature and authentic approaches to developing the use of technology in a New Zealand school. They have provided both a technical and pedagogical environment that has fostered innovation and growth for students and staff. They have evaluated the successes and adapted the delivery of assessment and curriculum based upon what will provide the best outcomes for their learners.

 

                            Pakuranga College should be proud to be one of the leaders of the authentic use of technology in New Zealand schools.  The regular and successful use of a variety of applications, devices and other hardware has become second nature to the teachers and student at the school. This reflects the long-term investment the school has made in ensuring things are done right."
