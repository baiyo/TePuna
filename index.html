    At Pakuranga, our goal is always to provide the best learning experiences, tailored for individual students. We have a rich history of using digital tools both in and out of the classroom, and our teachers have a wealth of experience. Our students leave school with a strong background in working digitally and independently, well-equipped for the digital world



This website is here to support and inspire teachers in the appropriate and innovative use of digital tools for learning, and is a record of the main e-learning professional learning opportunities that continue to be provided at Pakuranga College.
